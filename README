This is a plugin for rendering/using bibtex information in Dokuwiki pages.

The plugin itself lives in the bibtex/ directory, while the files in
lib/ take care of propertly displaying the pages for bibtex entries/
(basically displaying a code block with the relevant bibtex code
inside).

Supported markups:
- <BIBTEX [file=value_file] [style=value_style] [sort=value_sort]> : displays 
  all the corresponding citations contained in the page bib:value_file, with 
  formatting style value_style ordered by value_sort

- {[file:reference]} : allows to cite a reference extracted from a file
